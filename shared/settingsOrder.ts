 *
 *   - Mobile only: Translation Only, Cantillation, Nikud, Clear Storage
 *   - Web only:    Design System, Mobile Design Guide
 *
 * Dependency rules (rendered state may gate visibility/disabled):
 *   - Sefer Style requires Full Chapter enabled.
 *   - Sefer Style is enabled only in single-text mode
 *     (Hebrew Only or Translation Only).
 *   - Hebrew-dependent controls (Qumran, Hebrew Only, Cantillation,
 *     Nikud) are dimmed/disabled when Translation Only is active.
